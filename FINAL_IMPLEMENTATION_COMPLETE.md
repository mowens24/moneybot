    std::shared_ptr<MarketDataSimulator> simulator;
    std::shared_ptr<MultiExchangeGateway> gateway;
    
    void updateMetricsFromLiveData() {
        // Real-time P&L updates every 5 seconds
        // Dynamic trade generation with realistic win rates
        // Portfolio value recalculation based on live prices
        // Risk metrics adjustment with market conditions
    }
};
```

#### 2. **Advanced Order Book Widget** 📖
```cpp
class AdvancedOrderBookWidget {
    static void RenderOrderBook(symbol, simulator, depth=20);
    static void RenderDepthChart(bids, asks, mid_price);
    static void RenderOrderFlow(symbol);
    
    // Features:
    // - 20-level order book display
    // - Visual depth chart with bid/ask curves
    // - Real-time spread calculation
    // - Cumulative size tracking
};
```

#### 3. **Real-Time Arbitrage Detection** 🎯
```cpp
// Dynamic arbitrage calculation using live simulator data
for (exchanges) {
    for (symbols) {
        auto tick1 = simulator->getLatestTick(symbol, exchange1);
        auto tick2 = simulator->getLatestTick(symbol, exchange2);
        
        double profit_bps = calculateArbitrageProfit(tick1, tick2);
        if (profit_bps >= min_threshold) {
            displayOpportunity(symbol, exchanges, profit_bps);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. **Professional Menu System** 🎛️
```cpp
// Main menu bar with comprehensive controls
if (ImGui::BeginMainMenuBar()) {
    Dashboard: Main | Portfolio | Market Data | Arbitrage | Risk | Strategy
    Trading: Emergency Stop | Pause/Resume | Optimize | Rebalance
    Analysis: Generate Report | Backtest | Risk Analysis
